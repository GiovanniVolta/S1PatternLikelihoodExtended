# S1PatternLikelihoodExtended
S1 pattern likelihood extended for high energy analysis

The cut has been difined with background data (/dali/lgrandi/ccapelli/haxcache/final_SR1) and it has been optimized unitll the RoI of nuetrinoless double beta decay analysis, namely 2x10^4 PE.
The defination of the cut is obtain by combinig the selection in two parameter space: (z; S1 pattern fit bottom hax) and (S1; S1 pattern fit bottom hax).
